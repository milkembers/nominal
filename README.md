# 🌙🌸 nominal

a minimal, dark theme with a pop of color that hopes to improve the design - at least a little bit

![preview](https://milkembers.github.io/nominal/assets/prev.png?)

## features

- cute accent colours for checkboxes and selections
- blurred context menus and backdrops
- hides many annoyances like the nitro shop, avatar decorations and welcome stickers
- ~~nitro colour theme friendly~~ (needs a little work after the 10/23 update, not likely to fix)

## install

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> make sure to enable dark mode in settings for the theme to apply properly!
